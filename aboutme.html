    <p>
      Like I stated before my name is John.<br>
      <br>
      I'm a 15 year old student who lives in the United States and was born to immigrant parents.<br>
      <br>
      I'm shy. I'm Independent. I'm creative. I'm a perfectionist.<br>
      <br>
      Due to my shy nature I've become a reserved yet independent individual. I work well independently, none the less, I can also work well in a team.<br>
      <br>
      I take much pride in my work and always aim towards achieving perfection. Often spending hours on a single piece of work. <br>
      <br>
      I'm artistic and find pleasure in painting and drawing despite the fact I lack any drawing ability. <br>
      <br>
      This passion has also led to new passions such as the one's below as well as passion in the digital world.<br>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
      </b></a>

    <br>
    <p>
      Around a year ago I found a passion for photography. I would always see people with large cameras snapping photos left and right. By the end, they would have beautiful photos which captured a moment in time. I always found it fascinating but
      never believed I could do the same.<br>
      <br>
      Although I didn't have any of the advanced equipment professionals had, I tried to pursue a hobby of photography. At first, taking photos with my phone. They usually didn't look very good, but I continued.<br>
      <br>
      Then I discovered Adobe Photoshop and began tweaking part of my photos.<br>
      <br>
      Slowly I began to improve my photos.<br>
      <br>
      Now in present, I finally bought a camera. However, my photos still appear like they are shot by an amateur. My Photoshop skills are still quite awful. However, I still enjoy photography and will continue it. As it brings me joy being able to
      create what I perceive to be beautiful pieces.<br>

        <h3>Cinematohraphy / Video Editing</h3>
      </b></a>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      Cinematography is still a very recent hobby. It was mostly the result of a combination of constant film school projects in the past and my photography hobby.<br>
      <br>
      I enjoy filming, however, also find it frustrating as I always find flaws and have to retake a scene.<br>
      <br>
      Through the video making process, I enjoy editing the most. I get to incorporate my creativity and taste in music. Not only that but it's rewarding being able to take multiple clips and being able to watch it from scratch turn into a film.<br>
      <br>
      Often during my films I try to aim towards creating something that is ascetically pleasing while also being calming. If possible getting a laugh or two from the audience.<br>
      <br>
      I still have a lot to learn about cinematography and editing. Recently, starting to use more professional software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. However, I hope in the future I'll be able to produce better quality films that I can go and proudly
      show to people.<br>
